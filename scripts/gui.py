# Description:
#     Entry point for the ACSL UAV Simulator control panel GUI. Launches the
#     application shell (scripts/acsl_gui/shell.py) with the pages registered
#     below. Today that is just the Settings page (a comment-preserving
#     editor for config/*.yaml); Run/Build/Clean/wrapper pages are meant to
#     be added to the PAGES list here as they're written, with no changes
#     needed to the shell itself.
#
#     Run from anywhere with:
#         python3 scripts/gui.py
